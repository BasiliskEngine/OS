# An Operating System
Don't forget to add source files and headers to 
  "all:" in Makefile

If error occurs in file, but the error is resolved, edit that file, build that file, remove the edits, then build again (fixes problem)

"floppy.img" contained GRUB loaded onto it before initial development of the OS commenced.
Later, it is likely that I will write my own bootloader for the OS instead of GRUB.
  But GRUB, made it easier to get development started.
